<span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="ID_mapping_in_mounts">1.1. ID mapping in mounts</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line874">This release adds a new system call, mount_setattr(2), which allows to map the permission IDs of one mount to a completely different one. Simply put, different mounts can expose the same file or directory with different ownership. This solves a wide range of use cases that weren't possible before: <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></p><ul><li>Allow users to efficiently changing ownership on a per-mount basis without having to (recursively) chown(2) all files. In contrast to chown (2) changing ownership of large sets of files is instantenous with idmapped mounts. This is especially useful when ownership of a whole root filesystem of a virtual machine or container is changed. With idmapped mounts a single syscall mount_setattr(2) syscall will be sufficient to change the ownership of all files. <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span></li><li class="gap">It is now possible to share files from the host with unprivileged containers without having to change ownership permanently through chown(2).  <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li class="gap">It is possible to idmap a container's rootfs and without having to mangle every file. For example, Chromebooks use it to share the user's Download folder with their unprivileged containers in their Linux subsystem. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li><li class="gap">It is possible to share files between containers with non-overlapping idmapping <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span></li><li class="gap">It is possible to easily share files between multiple users or multiple machines especially in complex scenarios. For example, idmapped mounts will be used in the implementation of portable home directories in systemd-homed.service(8) where they allow users to move their home directory to an external storage device and use it on multiple computers where they are assigned different uids and gids. This effectively makes it possible to assign random uids and gids at login time. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span></li><li class="gap">Filesystem that lack a proper concept of ownership such as fat can use idmapped mounts to implement discretionary access (DAC) permission checking. <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span></li><li class="gap">Idmapped mounts always take the current ownership into account as idmappings specify what a given uid or gid is supposed to be mapped to. This contrasts with the chown(2) syscall which cannot by itself take the current ownership of the files it changes into account. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span></li></ul><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/837566/">ID mapping for mounted filesystems</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Allow_selecting_preempting_model_at_boot_and_run_time">1.2. Allow selecting preempting model at boot and run time</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line862">Linux supports different preemption models. Currently, using one preempt model (none/voluntary/model) is a build-time configuration option. This release adds the <tt>preempt=none/voluntary/full</tt> boot options (default: full), to allow distributions to build a PREEMPT kernel but fall back to close to PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY (or PREEMPT_NONE) runtime scheduling behavior via a boot-time selection. There's also the /debug/sched_debug switch to do this runtime. This feature is implemented via runtime patching (a new variant of static calls). <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="KFENCE_memory_error_detector">1.3. KFENCE memory error detector</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><p class="line874">Kernel Electric-Fence (KFENCE) is a new low-overhead sampling-based memory safety error detector. It detects heap out-of-bounds access, use-after-free, and invalid-free errors.  <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span></p><p class="line874">Linux already has a memory error detector, KASAN. KFENCE is not as thorough as KASAN, but unlike KASAN it has near zero performance overhead - it trades performance for precision. Because of the low overhead, it is designed to be enabled and used in production kernels. <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span></p><p class="line862">Documentation: <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/kfence.html">Kernel Electric-Fence (KFENCE)</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Support_for_the_ACRN_hypervisor">1.4. Support for the ACRN hypervisor</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><p class="line862">This release adds support for the <a class="https" href="https://projectacrn.org/">ACRN hypervisor</a>. ACRN is a Type 1 reference hypervisor stack, running directly on the bare-metal hardware, and is suitable for a variety of IoT and embedded device solutions. It implements a hybrid VMM architecture, using a privileged Service VM. The Service VM manages the system resources (CPU, memory, etc.) and I/O devices of User VMs. Multiple User VMs are supported, with each of them running Linux, Android OS or Windows. Both Service VM and User VMs are guest VM. <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span></p><p class="line862">Documentation: <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/virt/acrn/index.html">ACRN documentation</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Btrfs_initial_support_for_zoned_devices_and_subpage_block_size">1.5. Btrfs initial support for zoned devices and subpage block size</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line862">This release adds initial support for Btrfs in <a class="https" href="https://zonedstorage.io/introduction/zoned-storage/">zoned devices</a>, which are storage devices divided in zones that can only be written sequentially. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span></p><p class="line874">This release also adds support for block sizes smaller than the size of a memory page, which is a requirement sharing file systems between machines with different page sizes.  <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span></p><p class="line874">There are also several many performance improvements. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></p><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/853308/">Btrfs on zoned block devices</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Eager_NFS_writes">1.6. Eager NFS writes</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line862">This release adds support for eager writes: When enabled, writes will be sent immediately to the server, instead of letting the kernel send asynchronously in the background. This can help in some cases, like for example ensuring that a NFS client sees <tt>ENOSPC</tt> errors immediately. <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span></p><p class="line862">A set of mount options for NFS file systems is added to control how write() system calls react. <tt>writes=lazy</tt> is the default, and keeps the current behaviour. <tt>writes=eager</tt> means we send off the write immediately as an unstable write to the server. <tt>writes=wait</tt> means we send off the write as an unstable write, and then wait for the reply. <span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Non-blocking_path_lookup_while_opening_a_file">1.7. Non-blocking path lookup while opening a file</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><p class="line862">This release supports path name lookups that will not block under any circumstance. This means that the kernel will try to resolve the path with the cached data, but if it needs to do I/O, it will return an error. This is needed for io_uring(), but support in openat2() with the <tt>RESOLVE_CACHED</tt> flag has been added, too. <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span></p><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/843163/">Avoiding blocking file-name lookups</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Kernel_thread-based_NAPI_polling">1.8. Kernel thread-based NAPI polling</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><p class="line862">NAPI is a networking feature that polls the network device instead of waiting for IRQs, because it benefits performance in high-throughput loads. That polling, however, runs in <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-hacking/basics-softirqs.html">softirq context</a>, where the task scheduler can't see it, and it makes hard to tune the system for maximum performance. <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span></p><p class="line874">In this release, the polling can be configured to be done by a kernel thread. These kernel threads are managed by the task scheduler, which can make better scheduling decisions, and because they are visible by userspace administrators can pin a kernel threads to specific CPUs. <span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span></p><p class="line862">Recommended LWN article: <a class="https" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/833840/">NAPI polling in kernel threads</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span></p><p class="line867">
</p><h2 id="Dynamic_Thermal_Power_Management">1.9. Dynamic Thermal Power Management</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><p class="line874">The density of components greatly increased the last decade bringing a numerous number of heating sources which are monitored by more than 20 sensors on recent SoC. The skin temperature, which is the case temperature of the device, must stay below approximately 45°C in order to comply with the legal requirements. <span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span></p><p class="line874">The skin temperature is managed as a whole by an user space daemon, which is catching the current application profile, to allocate a power budget to the different components where the resulting heating effect will comply with the skin temperature constraint. This technique is called the Dynamic Thermal Power Management. <span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-84"></span></p><p class="line874">This series provides a Dynamic Thermal Power Management framework to provide an unified way to act on the power of the devices. <span class="anchor" id="line-85"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span></p><p class="line862">Documentation: <a class="https" href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/power/powercap/dtpm.html">Dynamic Thermal Power Management framework</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span></p><p class="line867">
